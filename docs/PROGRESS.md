# Progress

**Mission.** Build the nervous system of the Frollie booth — sign-in, sale, payment, refund, stock — on a single Android device, in production, replacing the manual paper system before v1.0 ships.

Living kanban for Frollie POS. Update as work lands. AI agents read this before starting a task and update it after.

**Legend:** ✅ done · 🔄 in progress · 📋 planned (next up) · 🗂️ backlog (not yet planned)

**Source of truth:** phase definitions come from [`WORKFLOW.md` § Releases](./WORKFLOW.md#releases). Behaviour rules come from [`ADR/`](./ADR/). Screen layouts come from `frollie-pos design files/project/wireframes/*.jsx` (gitignored — local only).

**How to read a row:** each phase is broken into three lanes — **Backend** (`convex/`), **Frontend** (`src/`), **Cross-cutting** (ADRs, schema, infra). A phase ships when every item in every lane is ✅.

---

## Task ID format (for agent-addressable tasks)

From v0.3 onward, every task is addressable by a stable **Task ID** so agents can claim, update, and reference it atomically. v0.2 tasks (shipped) are unaddressed — historical record only.

**ID shape:** `<phase>-<lane>-<slug>`
- `phase` — `v02`, `v03`, `v04`, `v05`, `v06`, `v10` (dots stripped from `v0.X`)
- `lane` — `be` (backend, `convex/`), `fe` (frontend, `src/`), `xc` (cross-cutting)
- `slug` — short kebab-case noun, unique within the phase+lane

**Per-task metadata block** (indented bullets under the task line):

```markdown
- 📋 **[vXX-be-example]** `someFile.ts` — short description
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `vXX-be-other`, `vXX-xc-schema`        (use other Task IDs, or `none`)
  - **docs:** [ADR-NNN](./ADR/...), [CLAUDE.md §section](../CLAUDE.md), [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] First concrete step
    - [ ] Second concrete step
    - [ ] Tests: the cases that prove it works
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
```

(The `vXX-be-example` placeholder is not a real Task ID — it's chosen to never collide with the regex parsers used by `/progress` and `/progress-update`.)

**Agent values** (from the available roster):
`convex-expert` · `frontend-integrator` · `ui-component-builder` · `code-reviewer` · `feature-dev:code-architect` · `general-purpose` · `—` (no specific agent — usually cross-cutting ADR/schema work)

**Slash-commands operating on this file:**
- `/progress` — read-only query: filter by phase, lane, agent, status, ID, or `--ready` (deps satisfied). Default shows in-progress + planned for the active phase.
- `/progress-update <task-id>` — atomic write: status, subtask checkbox, commit SHA, owner, note. Required when transitioning planned → in-progress → done.

When status changes to `🔄 in-progress`, the agent claiming it adds an `**owner:**` line. When status changes to `✅ done`, the title line gets `(commit-sha)` appended and the owner line is stripped.

## v0.2 — auth + catalog ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Staff sign in with a PIN on a registered device and see the menu.
Merged 2026-05-26 via PR #1 (commit `c051211`). 110 tests passing.

**You'll be able to:**
- Open the POS on a registered Android, tap your name, enter your 4-digit PIN, and land on the home screen
- Browse the menu (Dubai chocolate cookies, all pack sizes) — works offline, catalog is cached
- Get protected by a 3-strike, 60-second PIN lockout per staff member
- Activate a new device only via a one-time 6-digit code issued by a manager

**Still not yet:**
- Take a sale or accept payment
- See transaction history, issue refunds, or manage stock
- Anything beyond sign-in + browsing the menu

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `schema.ts` — 11 tables (staff, sessions, auth_attempts, devices, pending_setups, inventory_skus, products, components, stock_levels, idempotency, audit_log)
- ✅ `auth.ts` + `authActions.ts` — argon2id PIN hashing in Node action, V8/Node split per ADR-004; 3-strike 60s lockout (ADR-002); idempotent fail-record; repeat-lock audit
- ✅ `staff.ts` — `createStaff`, device registration (`generateDeviceSetupCode`, `activateDevice` with crypto-secure codes), `isDeviceRegistered`
- ✅ `products.ts` — `catalog` query (filtered by active product + active SKU)
- ✅ `audit.ts` — append-only `logAudit` helper, manager-gated `list` query (ADR-007)
- ✅ `idempotency.ts` — `withIdempotency` HOF with pre-cache `authCheck`, duplicate-tolerant reads (ADR-013)
- ✅ `seed.ts` + `seedActions.ts` — dev-only reset with prod-slug deny-list

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `hooks/useSession.ts` — localStorage + Convex validation, same-tab subscriber sync
- ✅ `hooks/useDeviceId.ts` — localStorage + IDB backup (strategic-§6), returns null while resolving
- ✅ `hooks/useIdempotency.ts` — stable UUID per intent
- ✅ `hooks/useCatalogCache.ts` — IDB snapshot of catalog (ADR-025), Effect race-guard
- ✅ `lib/format.ts` — `rp()` (IDR) + Jakarta-tz date helpers (ADR-015)
- ✅ `components/layout/{ConnDot, DeviceActivation, RootLayout}` — gates, connection indicator
- ✅ `components/auth/{PinEntry, StaffListItem}` — 4-dot indicator + NumericKeypad
- ✅ `routes/{login, home, activate}` — LoginA + HomeNav wireframes
- ✅ `router.tsx` — `/activate` public route added

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ vitest + jsdom (frontend) + edge-runtime (backend) env split, convex-test, fake-indexeddb
- ✅ TDD per task, atomic commits, every public mutation accepts `idempotencyKey`
- ✅ ADRs honored: 001-005 (auth), 007 (audit), 013 (idempotency), 015 (IDR), 016+017 (product/inventory split), 025 (offline catalog), 031 (server time), strategic-§1 + §6
- ✅ Telegram POC playground at `/dev/telegram` — proves round-trip Convex ↔ Telegram (bot `@FrolliePOS_Bot`, dev chat `-5247663806`). Three templates (approval / shift summary / custom), HTML-escape helper, webhook with secret verification + idempotency, convex-test coverage. Spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-telegram-poc-design.md`, plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-telegram-poc.md`, runbook `docs/RUNBOOK-telegram.md`, portable pattern `docs/PATTERNS/telegram-bot-integration.md`. ADR-027 + ADR-033 graduation deferred to v0.4.

### v0.2 follow-ups deferred to later phases
- 🗂️ `useIdempotency` IDB persistence → v0.3 (when payments expose the cost of reload-mid-payment)
- 🗂️ `withIdempotency` error-caching design re-evaluation → v0.3
- 🗂️ `listStaff` pin_hash strip → v0.5 (when manager portal lands)
- 🗂️ `rp()` negative-amount handling → v0.5 (refunds)
- 🗂️ Playwright E2E for offline catalog + device activation → v0.6
- 🗂️ Telegram POC graduation → v0.4: replace ADR-027 (WA manager approval) + ADR-033 (founders shift summary) with the validated Telegram bot pattern. Also: error toasting (Sonner) in playground forms, replace `payload: v.any()` with per-kind discriminated union, integrate `pos_approval_requests` instead of sandbox `telegram_log` table.

---

## v0.2.1 — Architecture restructure ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** `convex/` refactored into module layout per [ADR-034](./ADR/034-deep-modules-surface-apis.md). Module-boundary lint as hard CI gate. Stable string identifiers (staffCode, productCode, componentCode) added as optional fields + seed allocation + format conformance tests. External API surface scaffolded under `convex/api/v1/` (endpoints deferred to v0.3).
Merged 2026-05-26.

**You'll be able to:**
- _(nothing user-visible — purely engineering scaffolding to keep future phases shipping fast)_

**Still not yet:**
- Same as v0.2 — this phase changed nothing for end users

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ Module-boundary ESLint rule + CI gate (`tools/eslint-rules/no-cross-module-db-access.js`, `eslint.config.js`)
- ✅ Schema composed from per-module fragments (`auth/`, `catalog/`, `idempotency/`, `audit/`, `telegram/`)
- ✅ All modules migrated: `auth/{public,internal,actions,sessions,schema}.ts`, `staff/{public,internal}.ts`, `catalog/{public,schema}.ts`, `audit/{public,internal,schema}.ts`, `idempotency/{internal,schema}.ts`, `seed/{internal,actions}.ts`
- ✅ Session helpers extracted to `auth/sessions.ts` (breaks audit→staff backwards dep)
- ✅ `logAudit` confirmed as plain helper (ADR-034 amended)
- ✅ Stable codes (`staffCode` `S-NNNN`, `productCode` `<PREFIX>_<N>PC`, `componentCode` UPPERCASE) added as optional fields + seed allocates them + format conformance tests in `convex/_codes/__tests__/`

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ All `api.<module>.<fn>` → `api.<module>.public.<fn>` (or `.actions.<fn>` for Node actions) — 5 files: `useSession`, `RootLayout`, `DeviceActivation`, `login`, `home` (+ `useCatalogCache` doc comment)

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ `convex/api/v1/{_auth.ts,README.md}` scaffold (no endpoints yet)
- ✅ `docs/PUBLIC_API.md` stubbed
- ✅ `docs/SCHEMA.md` reframed as POS-internal
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` file-locations updated for module layout
- ✅ ADR-034 amended (§"Cross-module patterns — Audit logging")
- ✅ CHANGELOG entry

### v0.2.1 follow-ups deferred
- 🗂️ Flip `code` fields to required → v0.3 (needs `createStaff` allocation logic for race-safe S-NNNN; cascades through `_seedStaffCommit_internal`, `_createStaffCommit_internal`, and raw test inserts)
- 🗂️ External API endpoints + bearer-token impl + PUBLIC_API.md endpoint specs + contract snapshot tests + `audit_log.source` `"api_consumer"` enum + PII scope tests → v0.3
- 🗂️ Telegram POC graduation → v0.4

---

## v0.3 — sale flow + Xendit ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Staff take a sale and accept QRIS or BCA VA payment, with retries that don't double-charge.
**Shipped:** 29 May 2026 via PR #3. 288 tests passing; payments live-verified on dev (QRIS + BCA FVA end-to-end via Xendit test-mode simulate, ADR-036). Prod deploy deferred to the v1.0 cutover.

**You'll be able to:**
- Build a cart with items + quantities, see live totals
- Charge customers via QRIS scan **or** BCA Virtual Account (Xendit)
- Auto-confirm via webhook **or** polling fallback — staff never wait wondering if it worked
- Save sales as drafts (offline too) and resume them later
- Sell even at zero stock — the sale never blocks; it's flagged for later manager review
- Bootstrap a fresh prod database with just Lucas (PIN 1111), then rotate that PIN immediately via in-app change-PIN

**Still not yet:**
- Issue refunds (lands in v0.5)
- Approve manager actions remotely — overrides still need a manager physically at the booth (v0.4)
- Add/edit staff or products in-app — both still managed via the Convex dashboard until the manager portal (v0.5)
- See receipts, transaction history, the dashboard, or stock management (v0.5)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ **[v03-be-bootstrap]** Bootstrap action: insert single manager "Lucas" with PIN 1111 on a fresh deployment (668b204)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `none`
  - **docs:** [ADR-001](./ADR/001-pin-only-authentication.md), [ADR-004](./ADR/004-pin-hashing-server-side.md), [ADR-034 §stable identifiers](./ADR/034-deep-modules-surface-apis.md)
  - **why:** v0.2.1 ships dev seed (`seed/actions:reset`) that wipes + populates Lucas + 4 staff + 5 SKUs + 7 products as bootstrap test data. Code-wise the bootstrap action is needed early (v0.3) so the "fresh-deployment" code path is testable + exercised in dev. **Prod cutover is deferred to v1.0** — until then, all environments run on dev/staging deployments with the existing seed data; bootstrap is exercised against a wipe-and-bootstrap dev cycle, not against prod.
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] New `convex/seed/actions.ts` action: `bootstrap` — argon2id-hashes PIN 1111 + commits via internal mutation
    - [x] Internal mutation: refuse if `staff` table has any row (idempotent — safe to re-run; errors clearly if already bootstrapped)
    - [x] Insert single row: `{ name: "Lucas", code: "S-0001", role: "manager", active: true, pin_hash: argon2id("1111"), created_at: Date.now() }`
    - [x] Audit log: `actor_id: "system"`, `action: "staff.bootstrapped"`, `source: "system"`, `entity_type: "staff"`, `entity_id: <new id>`
    - [x] Document the bootstrap-then-change-pin sequence in `docs/RUNBOOK.md` (purely dev/staging instructions in v0.3 — prod section added at v1.0 cutover)
    - [x] Tests: bootstrap on empty DB succeeds + creates exactly 1 row, bootstrap with any existing row throws, audit row written
  - **notes:** _Prod cutover postponed to v1.0 per [decision 2026-05-27]. Bootstrap ships in v0.3 as the code path that the eventual v1.0 cutover will use — keeping it implemented + tested early prevents a rushed bootstrap landing right before launch._

- ✅ **[v03-be-change-pin]** `auth/actions:changePin` — staff can change their own PIN (a02bfe3)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `none`
  - **docs:** [ADR-001](./ADR/001-pin-only-authentication.md), [ADR-002](./ADR/002-lockout-policy.md), [ADR-004](./ADR/004-pin-hashing-server-side.md), [ADR-005](./ADR/005-manager-pin-one-off.md), [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md)
  - **why:** General staff capability — any staff member rotates their own PIN. Also the cleanup path for the bootstrap PIN 1111 once a fresh deployment is bootstrapped via [v03-be-bootstrap].
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `action: changePin(sessionId, currentPin, newPin, idempotencyKey)` in `convex/auth/actions.ts` — argon2id verify currentPin against `staff.pin_hash`, then argon2id-hash newPin, commit via internal mutation
    - [x] Internal mutation: `_changePinCommit_internal` — atomic patch of `staff.pin_hash`, requires session resolves to same `staff_id` as PIN owner (no admin override; managers can't change others' PINs via this action — see [v03-be-reset-staff-pin] for the manager-reset flow)
    - [x] PIN validation: 4 digits, numeric only, reject if equal to currentPin (force actual change)
    - [x] Lockout interaction: failed currentPin verify counts toward the lockout in `pos_auth_attempts` — same counter as login per ADR-002. 3 failed change-PIN attempts triggers the same 60s lockout. **Decided 2026-05-27.**
    - [x] Audit log: `actor_id: <staffId>`, `action: "staff.pin_changed"`, `source: "booth_inline"`, `entity_type: "staff"`, `entity_id: <staffId>`, no before/after pin (never log PINs)
    - [x] Idempotency: wrap with `withIdempotency` — replay returns success without re-hashing (PIN already changed)
    - [x] Tests: happy path, wrong currentPin throws + lockout counter increments, newPin == currentPin throws, replay via idempotencyKey returns same response, audit row written without PIN values, 3 failed verifies trigger lockout
  - **notes:** _Frontend UI deferred to v0.5 manager portal — interim staff-self-change-PIN UI not in v0.3 scope. Combined with prod-cutover deferral to v1.0, this is acceptable: bootstrap + changePin are exercised end-to-end via `npx convex run` against dev/staging in v0.3, real UI lands when manager portal does._

- ✅ **[v03-be-reset-staff-pin]** `auth/actions:resetStaffPin` — manager resets another staff member's PIN (manager-PIN-gated per ADR-005) (a02bfe3)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v03-be-change-pin`
  - **docs:** [ADR-005](./ADR/005-manager-pin-one-off.md), [ADR-001](./ADR/001-pin-only-authentication.md), [ADR-004](./ADR/004-pin-hashing-server-side.md), [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md), [ADR-027](./ADR/027-wa-approval-via-staff-own-wa.md) _(WA approval path superseded by Telegram in v0.4)_
  - **why:** Staff member forgets their PIN or is locked out → manager resets. Per ADR-005, "PIN resets" is on the manager-PIN-gated list. Without this, a locked-out or forgetful staff member is permanently locked out short of dashboard intervention. Manager-PIN gate is one-off (not a persistent mode).
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `action: resetStaffPin(sessionId, targetStaffCode, newPin, managerPin, idempotencyKey)` in `convex/auth/actions.ts` — caller must have manager role on `sessionId`, re-verifies `managerPin` via argon2id (one-off gate per ADR-005), then argon2id-hashes `newPin` and commits via shared internal mutation
    - [x] Use `staffCode` (S-NNNN) as target identifier — not `staff_id` — per ADR-034 stable IDs
    - [x] Internal mutation: reuse `_changePinCommit_internal` from [v03-be-change-pin] with an arg shape that supports target-id + manager-approver-id (refactor needed when both tasks land)
    - [x] Auth: `requireManagerSession` for caller, then explicit `managerPin` re-verify (defense-in-depth; manager-mode-not-persistent)
    - [x] Reject if `targetStaffCode` is the manager themselves (use changePin instead)
    - [x] Clear `pos_auth_attempts` row for the target staff on successful reset (unblocks them from any active lockout)
    - [x] Audit log: `actor_id: <managerStaffId>`, `mgr_approver_id: <managerStaffId>` (same — booth_inline), `action: "staff.pin_reset"`, `source: "booth_inline"`, `entity_type: "staff"`, `entity_id: <targetStaffId>`, no PIN values logged
    - [x] Idempotency: wrap with `withIdempotency` — replay returns success
    - [x] Tests: happy path manager-resets-staff, non-manager session rejected, wrong managerPin rejected + counts toward lockout, target=self rejected, lockout row cleared for target, audit row has correct `mgr_approver_id`, replay deduped
    - [x] Document v0.4 augmentation: when Telegram approval lands, this action gains an off-booth path via approval-request flow (manager not at booth approves via Telegram callback). v0.3 only supports the in-person manager-PIN path.
  - **notes:**
    - _The shared `_changePinCommit_internal` mutation needs an arg shape that handles both self-change (no `mgr_approver_id`) and manager-reset (with `mgr_approver_id`). Whichever of [v03-be-change-pin] or [v03-be-reset-staff-pin] lands first defines the initial signature; second one refactors as needed. v0.4 graduation: per the recent Telegram pivot ([decision 2026-05-26]), this is the canonical action that the Telegram approval flow will gate at v0.4 — keep the action shape stable._
    - 2026-05-28: Booth-inline path shipped (Task 17). Off-booth Telegram approval path ALSO shipped early in v0.3 (approvals module: notifyStaffLockout + approveStaffPinReset, commit 9e76f73) — originally scoped to v0.4.

- ✅ **[v03-xc-schema]** Schema additions: `pos_transactions`, `pos_transaction_lines`, `pos_drafts`, `pos_xendit_invoices` (0e03085)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `none`
  - **docs:** [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md), [ADR-014](./ADR/014-single-xendit-invoice-per-transaction.md), [ADR-018](./ADR/018-negative-stock-allowed-flagged.md), [CLAUDE.md §business-rules-1](../CLAUDE.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `pos_transactions` table (with `flags` bitfield for NEG_STOCK)
    - [x] `pos_transaction_lines` table with `unit_price` + `product_name_snapshot`
    - [x] `pos_drafts` table
    - [x] `pos_xendit_invoices` table (audit log for invoice ids)
    - [x] Update [SCHEMA.md](./SCHEMA.md) with the new tables before code
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-05-28: pos_drafts table NOT created — drafts modeled as status=draft on pos_transactions instead. pos_stock_levels moved catalog→inventory; stock_movements/vouchers/approvals tables added.

- ✅ **[v03-be-transactions]** `transactions.ts` — cart, draft, void; snapshot prices + names on lines (3f5e706)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v03-xc-schema`
  - **docs:** [CLAUDE.md §business-rules-1](../CLAUDE.md), [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md), [ADR-031](./ADR/031-convex-server-time-wins.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] Mutation: `createDraft(args, idempotencyKey)`
    - [x] Mutation: `addLine(txnId, productId, qty)` — snapshot `unit_price` + `product_name`
    - [x] Mutation: `removeLine(txnId, lineId)`
    - [x] Mutation: `voidTransaction(txnId, reason)` + audit log
    - [x] Mutation: `saveAsDraft(txnId)` / `resumeDraft(draftId)`
    - [x] Tests: snapshot pricing immutability, idempotency dedup, void path, draft round-trip
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-05-28: Shipped as client-side Zustand cart + single commitCart funnel + drafts CRUD (resumeDraft/deleteDraft), per post-staffreview spec — NOT per-line addLine/removeLine server mutations as originally scoped. Void deferred to v0.5.

- ✅ **[v03-be-xendit-invoice]** `xendit/invoice.ts` — invoice creation with `payment_methods: ["QRIS", "BCA"]` (35989f7)

  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `requestPayment(txnId)` — orchestrates createInvoice + state transition
    - [x] `confirmPayment(txnId, source)` — idempotent, source ∈ {webhook, polling, manual}
    - [x] State machine: draft → awaiting_payment → paid | cancelled
    - [x] Tests: three confirmation paths, idempotent re-fire, state-transition guard
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v03-be-payments`
  - **docs:** [CLAUDE.md §Xendit-integration-notes](../CLAUDE.md#xendit-integration-notes), [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] Convex `httpAction` exposing webhook endpoint
    - [x] HMAC signature verification via `XENDIT_CALLBACK_TOKEN` (reject on mismatch)

  - **docs:** [CLAUDE.md §strategic-foundations-§8](../CLAUDE.md), [ADR-000 §8](./ADR/000-strategic-foundations.md#8-three-path-payment-confirmation-operational-pattern)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `pollInvoice(invoiceId)` — GET `/v2/invoices/{id}`
    - [x] Scheduler: kick off after 2s wait, repeat every 2s until 60s
    - [x] On paid: call `confirmPayment(txnId, "polling")` — idempotent against webhook winning
    - [x] Tests: polling stops once confirmed, ceiling honored, idempotency vs webhook
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-05-28: Shipped as payments.actions.checkInvoiceStatus (GET status → _onPaidPolling funnel) + useXenditPayment hook driving 2s/60s cadence — no separate xendit/polling.ts file.

- ✅ **[v03-be-xendit-dedicated-apis]** Xendit dedicated-API fix — QR Codes (QRIS) + FVA (BCA) inline, webhook reparse, polling/reconciliation retired (ADR-036) (4ad10b8)
  - **agent:** `claude`
  - **deps:** `v03-be-payments`, `v03-be-xendit-webhook`, `v03-be-xendit-polling`, `v03-fe-use-xendit-payment`
  - **docs:** [ADR-036](./ADR/036-xendit-dedicated-apis-inline.md), [plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-05-28-xendit-dedicated-apis.md), [staffreview](./reviews/staffreview-feat-v0.3-sale-xendit-2026-05-29.md)
  - **subtasks:**

    - [x] Additive `receipt_id`/`payment_source` columns + `PAYMENT_AMOUNT_MISMATCH` flag threaded into the funnel
    - [x] Thin `requestPayment` onto adapter (both methods)
    - [x] Rewrite webhook to QR Codes v2 shape (match on `qr_id`, always-200, 401-on-missing-config); retire polling + startup reconciliation
    - [x] Render scannable QRIS via `qrcode.react`
    - [x] Thin `retryWithFreshInvoice` onto adapter (unique ref, local supersede, no expire)
    - [x] ADR-036 + supersede ADR-011/014, amend §8/ADR-026; CHANGELOG/SCHEMA/CLAUDE
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-05-29: Supersedes the original Invoice-API impl (v03-be-payments/-webhook/-polling) — the unified Invoice API never returned qr_string/account_number at create (only invoice_url), blocking all v0.3 payments. Built via subagent-driven-development (per-task spec + code-quality review) + triple-review. Commits 1136500..4ad10b8. BCA FVA path is code-complete but LIVE-UNVERIFIED (Decision C). HARD GATE remaining: a dashboard simulate-payment must write `paid` end-to-end (live Xendit webhook config).
    - 2026-05-29: HARD GATE ✅ PASSED — live-verified end-to-end on dev (`helpful-grasshopper-46`) via Xendit test-mode simulate. QRIS (`qr.payment` SUCCEEDED → receipt R-2026-0001) AND BCA FVA (flat callback, no `event` field, matches on `callback_virtual_account_id` == stored FVA id → receipt R-2026-0002) both confirmed → `paid` via webhook with no manual action, RRN captured, no mismatch flag. Decision C (BCA live-unverified) is CLOSED. Prereq fixed: `XENDIT_CALLBACK_TOKEN` must be set under that exact name (dev had the token under `XENDIT_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`, which would 401 every callback).

## v0.4 — Telegram approval + self-registration + founders share ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Managers approve manual payment overrides from anywhere via a Telegram URL-button; Telegram groups self-register with the bot via /register; founders receive an automatic daily sales summary at 22:00 WIB.
**Shipped:** 30 May 2026 on branch `feat/v0.4-telegram-approval`. [Plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-05-29-v0.4-telegram-approval.md), [spec](./superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-v0.4-telegram-approval-design.md), [ADR-035](./ADR/035-telegram-as-internal-comms.md) (amended), [ADR-037](./ADR/037-telegram-self-registration.md) (new).

**You'll be able to:**
- Request off-booth manager approval when QRIS/BCA VA doesn't auto-confirm — a Telegram card lands in the managers group, manager taps the link and enters their PIN to approve or deny
- Trust approvals are single-use, 60-minute expiry, PIN-gated (ADR-029: token authorizes VIEW; PIN authorizes ACT)
- Register a Telegram group with the bot by messaging `/register` — no hardcoded `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`; managers assign the `managers` or `founders` role via the in-app admin page
- Receive an automated daily founders summary at 22:00 WIB (opt-out via manager toggle)

**Still not yet:**
- Issue refunds end-to-end (off-booth approval path is ready; refund logic ships v0.5)
- Manager home screen / approvals queue in-app (v0.5)
- Multi-kind approval queue UI for managers (v0.5)

    - [x] Existing `staff_pin_reset` callers unchanged
    - [x] Tests: `manual_payment_override` round-trip, invalid context rejected
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

- ✅ **[v04-be-approvals-lifecycle-internals]** `approvals/internal.ts` — add `_markDenied_internal`, `_listPendingByKind_internal`, `_linkTelegramMessage_internal` (db125d3)

  - **docs:** [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md)

  - **notes:** _(empty)_

- ✅ **[v04-be-getbytoken-discriminate]** `approvals/public.ts` — generalize `getByToken` with per-kind discriminated display; add `getRequestStatus` reactive query (86942fa)

  - **notes:** _(empty)_

- ✅ **[v04-be-lib-helpers-port]** `convex/lib/` — port `chunking`, `constantTimeEqual`, `cronRetry`; add `sendTelegramHtml` to `telegramHtml.ts` (6546648)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `none`
  - **docs:** [PATTERNS/telegram-bot-integration.md](./PATTERNS/telegram-bot-integration.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `chunking.ts`, `constantTimeEqual.ts`, `cronRetry.ts` ported verbatim + tests
    - [x] `sendTelegramHtml(token, chatId, html)` added to existing `telegramHtml.ts`

  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v04-be-lib-helpers-port`, `v04-be-telegram-config`
  - **docs:** [ADR-037](./ADR/037-telegram-self-registration.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] Port `chatRegistry.ts` verbatim; adapt `admin*` → `mgr*` with `requireManagerSession`
    - [x] `mgrSendTest` as action; auth via `_requireManagerSession_internal` (action-safe)

    - [x] Tests: register upsert, assignRole uniqueness, archive-clears-role, role lookup, manager-vs-staff gate, idempotency dedup
  - **notes:** no happy-path test for `mgrSendTest` (manager + valid chat); redundant `isKnownTelegramRole` check in `mgrAssignRole` (defensible defense-in-depth since `assignRoleImpl` also checks).

- ✅ **[v04-be-telegram-commands]** `convex/telegram/{commands,registryCommands}.ts` — command-registry dispatcher + `/register`/`/start` self-registration commands (74c8c6f)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`

- ✅ **[v04-be-telegram-send-harden]** `convex/telegram/send.ts` — role-routed, idempotent, typed `sendTemplate`; audited send failures; URL-button approvals (9160a72)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v04-be-chatregistry-keystone`, `v04-be-approvals-kinds`
  - **docs:** [ADR-013](./ADR/013-idempotency-keys.md), [ADR-029](./ADR/029-token-authorizes-view-pin-authorizes-act.md)

    - [x] Action-level idempotency via `_lookup_internal` + `_writeCache_internal`
    - [x] On Telegram failure: audit row `telegram.send_failed` then rethrow
    - [x] `renderManualPaymentApproval` + URL-button ("Open approval →") added to `telegramHtml.ts`; POC `renderApproval` callback card deleted
    - [x] Tests: role resolution, message_id returned, malformed payload rejected
  - **notes:** `send.ts` switch cases use `as { ... }` casts because `v.union` payload isn't tagged — runtime-safe via the Convex validator but vulnerable to stale casts if shapes drift. Also: idempotency replay is not unit-tested (structurally sound, same pattern as `approveStaffPinReset`).

- ✅ **[v04-be-settings-module]** `convex/settings/{public,internal}.ts` — `getSettings` (read-time default ON) + `setFoundersSummaryEnabled` (manager-gated) (a5381d6)

  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] Mint 32-byte raw token; store SHA-256 hash only
    - [x] Dedup: skip if live pending request exists for the same `txnId`
    - [x] `sendTemplate` to `managers` role; link message-id to request (best-effort)
    - [x] On send failure: delete the pending request so next cycle retries cleanly
    - [x] Action-level idempotency cache
    - [x] Tests: creates pending row + Telegram send (mocked), dedup skips second call
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

- ✅ **[v04-be-approve-manual-payment]** `approvals/actions.ts` — `approveManualPayment` action; `source=telegram_approval` threaded through `_onPaidManual_internal` → `_confirmPaid_internal` (501f6c0)

    - [x] `_onPaidManual_internal` called with `source: "telegram_approval"`
    - [x] `_markResolved_internal` under the top-level idempotency key
    - [x] Tests: approve confirms txn + resolves request, wrong PIN records attempt, replay cached
  - **notes:** `withIdempotency` cache LABEL on `_markResolved_internal` still reads `"approvals.approveStaffPinReset"`; pure observability, no functional impact.

## v0.5.0 — App shell + session ergonomics + v0.4 stabilizers ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Every screen has consistent navigation, locking and resuming a shift is smoother, and the small stack of v0.4 follow-up bugs is cleared — the foundation every v0.5.1–v0.5.3 screen will sit on.
**Shipped:** 31 May 2026 on branch `feat/v0.5.0-foundation` (squash-merge `cb6e108`, PR #6). [Plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-05-30-v0.5.0-foundation.md), [spec](./superpowers/specs/2026-05-30-v0.5.0-foundation-design.md), [pre-impl staffreview](./reviews/staffreview-v0.5.0-foundation-design-2026-05-30.md), [post-impl staffreview](./reviews/staffreview-feat-v0.5.0-foundation-2026-05-31.md), new [PATTERN doc](./PATTERNS/idempotency-dual-call-authcheck.md), new [CLAUDE.md rule #21](../CLAUDE.md).
Decomposition rationale: [staffreview 2026-05-30](./reviews/staffreview-v0.5-split-2026-05-30.md). v0.5 was split into four sub-phases (v0.5.0 → v0.5.3) because the original scope (refunds + receipts + history + stock + dashboard + settlements + in-app admin) was three times v0.4's size. This slice was the plumbing prereq for the other three.

**You'll be able to:**
- Navigate from any screen back to home without using browser-back
- Lock the device and resume by entering the previous staff member's PIN (one tap to switch)
- Trust that off-booth approval links can't be brute-forced (per-token PIN attempt cap)
- See an awaiting-payment countdown on the charge screen so you know when the QR expires
- Cancel a sale and have any pending manager approval cancelled at the same time
- Call any active manager by name from the booth override picker (not just the logged-in one)

**Still not yet:**
- Issue refunds end-to-end (v0.5.1)
- Share public receipts to customers (v0.5.1)
- Log stock-in or run stock checks in-app (v0.5.2)
- View transaction history, see the dashboard, or reconcile settlements (v0.5.3)
- Manage staff or products in-app — still via the Convex dashboard (v0.5.3)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ **[v050-be-deny-autoflip]** `ApprovalPending` observes status flips and fires `onDenied`/`onExpired`; charge screen auto-flips back to ceiling CTAs (5a79497)
- ✅ **[v050-be-cancel-cancels-approval]** Cancel-sale cascades into pending `manual_payment_override` approvals; atomic via `_cancelCommit_internal` so retry can't strand them (db06244, post-/simplify atomicity fix a828f20)
- ✅ **[v050-be-mgr-picker-override]** `manuallyConfirmPayment` accepts `managerStaffCode`; any active manager can authorize from the booth (b22f0b8). UI picker landed alongside (c98d433)
- ✅ **[v050-be-awaiting-countdown]** `useCountdown` mm:ss + progress bar on `/sale/charge`, driven by invoice `created_at + 15min` (c98d433, NaN-guard 243ccd6)
- ✅ **[v050-be-cancel-pending-approval]** `approvals.public.cancelPendingRequest` manager mutation — first mutation BORN under the strict ESLint rule (b7e3908)
- ✅ **[v050-be-token-pin-cap]** 5-attempt per-token PIN cap on `/approve` actions; cap-trip auto-denies via shared `_markDeniedBySystem_internal` with `source: "system"`; new `REQUEST_REVOKED` error + dual-path revoke UI (370371a + delegation refactor 5ea7693)
- ✅ **[v050-be-recent-reset-filter]** `getRecentPinResetForStaff` excludes `resolved` rows; login success-toast no longer re-fires (3690c0f)
- ✅ **[v050-be-founders-race]** `sendTemplate` accepts `chatIdOverride`; cron resolves chat id once upfront, closes the role-unbind race window (0e58ce2)
- ✅ **[v050-be-kind-audit-verbs]** `KIND_AUDIT` per-kind verbs (`staff_pin_reset.denied`, `manual_payment_override.denied`); pre-v0.5.0 rows stay as-is per ADR-007 (5291ff2 + comment cleanup 506c6ec)
- ✅ **[v050-be-archived-filter]** `telegramChats` archived filter rewritten as JS post-filter; closes Convex optional-field gotcha; new `by_role` index (7631ee9)

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ **[v050-fe-nav-shell]** `AppHeader` (sticky 48px) + `SpokeLayout` (with `hideBack` prop for `charge-success`); `AbandonCartDialog` cart + payment variants; `useBlocker` catches header/browser/Android-gesture back uniformly via `useCallback`-stable predicates; `beforeunload` secondary guard. ~14 spoke routes migrated (d9b2181, 0398768, 11-commit migration starting 83f4b6a, predicate stability f6d8ad7)
- ✅ **[v050-fe-lock-route]** `routes/lock.tsx` confirm-dialog screen; calls existing `logout`; preserves `LAST_STAFF_KEY` for resume UX (a0ff841)
- ✅ **[v050-fe-lock-resume]** `useLastStaff` hook + login pre-stage effect; resume-on-prev-staff pre-stages PIN entry, silent fallback to list if deactivated; storage keys centralised in `src/lib/storage-keys.ts`; `storeSession(sessionId, staffId)` atomic (272875f + 2767cbf + ae813c6, ref-ordering fix 135f360)

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ **[v050-xc-eslint-idempotency]** ESLint rule `frollie-internal/idempotency-required` at severity `error`; asserts every `convex/<module>/public.ts` mutation has `idempotencyKey` + `withIdempotency` + `authCheck` slot; CI gate script asserts severity can't silently regress (6a3a81b + namespace fix 54ec2ee + value-ref fix 76df808 + nested-path fix 2675aa4 + flip-to-error c029cea). Every existing public mutation migrated to canonical `authCheck`-in-options pattern (Task 6 chain). Auth/cache-order regression test in `convex/idempotency/__tests__/authCacheOrder.test.ts` (9de945a)
- ✅ **[v050-xc-effective-status]** `effectiveStatus(row)` + `TOKEN_PIN_ATTEMPT_CAP` in `convex/approvals/lib.ts` — pure module; 5 reader sites migrated (`getByToken`, `getRequestStatus`, `getRecentPinResetForStaff`, `/approve` UI, `ApprovalPending`) (e61cf8c + 7e36907)
- ✅ **[v050-xc-spec]** Spec + plan + pre-impl staffreview written; per-task IDs above gained full metadata via the 26-task plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-30-v0.5.0-foundation.md` (df771b8, 0b6691a)
- ✅ **[v050-xc-docs]** CHANGELOG + CLAUDE.md rule #21 (idempotency dual-call authCheck pattern) + SCHEMA.md notes for `failed_pin_attempts` / widened `denied_by_manager_id` + API_REFERENCE.md new surface + new `docs/PATTERNS/idempotency-dual-call-authcheck.md` (0745306)

### Post-implementation review trail
- **Triple-review** (3 parallel agents — ADR-invariant, code-quality, deep-module staff) → 11 fix commits addressing audit-source threading, helper-extraction follow-through, `useBlocker` stability, `listActiveManagers` shape, `logout` graceful-idempotent semantics. Post-impl staffreview: [docs/reviews/staffreview-feat-v0.5.0-foundation-2026-05-31.md](./reviews/staffreview-feat-v0.5.0-foundation-2026-05-31.md). Verdict: net deeper modules; pre-impl criticals all addressed
- **`/simplify` max effort** (9 parallel finder angles → 1-vote verify → sweep) → 7 fix commits including the **critical regression catch**: triple-review's C1 fix wired `_cancelActiveInvoiceForTxn_internal` + cascade OUTSIDE `_cancelCommit_internal`'s `withIdempotency` transaction, so transient step-5/6 failures + retry would replay the cached step-4 success and silently strand uncancelled invoices and live approvals. Fix moved both inside the atomic mutation (a828f20)
- **`/ship-it` skill** built at `~/.claude/skills/ship-it/SKILL.md` — full push→PR→merge→sync flow using safe `git pull --rebase` + `git update-ref -d` primitives that bypass the harness deny list. Motivated by this PR's manual merge-sync friction

### Known follow-ups deferred to v0.5.1
- `useDeviceId.ts` `LS_KEY` constant should migrate to `src/lib/storage-keys.ts`
- 4 sale-route tests use bare `"frollie-session-id"` literal; import `SESSION_KEY` instead
- `pos_xendit_invoices` `by_role_archived` index now unused — drop in next schema pass
- `_resolveSession_internal` should add `staff.active` check to match `requireSession` semantics
- Extract `usePathChangeBlocker(shouldBlock)` hook (duplicated at `/sale` + `/sale/charge`)
- Extract `useEffectOnce` shared hook (`useRef(false)` pattern repeats 3x in tree)
- Wire `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` in `eslint.config.js` (devDep installed, not registered)
- Physical-device PWA smoke: Android gesture-back, browser back button, `beforeunload` prompt (code paths correct by inspection; need one tap on the booth device)

## v0.5.1 — Refunds + customer receipts ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Staff issue refunds; customers get a shareable signed-URL receipt that correctly reflects refunded lines without ever mutating the original sale.
Merged 2026-06-01 via PR #8 (receipts, commit `1e80eda`) + PR #9 (refunds + settlement, commit `88470b0`) + PR #10 (housekeeping, commit `1e4388f`).

**You'll be able to:**
- Issue refunds end-to-end — staff initiate, manager approves via Telegram, refund logged as a new row
- Share signed-URL receipts — customer scans or taps, gets an itemised receipt
- See refunded lines clearly on the public receipt, with the original sale never mutated
- Audit every refund with manager-approver, reason, and timestamp
- Track which approved refunds still owe the customer money — `settlement_status: pending → settled` (money moves manually in v1 per ADR-038)

**Still not yet:**
- Have the POS *send* refund money automatically — v1 records + audits the refund; the manager moves the cash manually in the Xendit/BCA dashboard, then marks it settled. Automated Disbursements/QRIS-refund API deferred to v1.1 (ADR-038)
- Log stock-in or run stock checks in-app (v0.5.2)
- View transaction history, see the dashboard, or reconcile settlements (v0.5.3)
- Configure the receipt template from the manager portal (v0.5.3 — v0.5.1 ships a hardcoded template)
- Manage staff or products in-app (v0.5.3)

### PR A — receipt subsystem (shipped 2026-06-01)

**Backend (`convex/`):**
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-schema` — `pos_receipt_html_cache` table + `pos_transactions.receipt_token` field [`ef05ecc`]
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-schema-test` — schema round-trip + optional-field test [`c7b2f6a`]
- ✅ `v05-be-mint-token-shared` — `mintUrlSafeToken` shared helper extracted from `approvals/actions.ts` [`b958e29`]
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-template` — paid-only HTML renderer + `formatWibDateTime` time helper [`f33040a`]
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-internal` — render + cache get/write + `_lazyMintReceiptToken_internal` (dormant) [`bfc16ef`]
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-token-mint` — `_confirmPaid` mints `receipt_token` internally [`963628c`]
- ✅ `v05-be-receipt-http` — `GET /r/:token` httpAction (24h cache, status guard, 404 page) [`97e0e92`]
- ✅ `v05-doc-pr-a` — PR A CHANGELOG + SCHEMA + CLAUDE + API_REFERENCE + PROGRESS [`5d2de88`]

### PR B — refund subsystem + settlement surface (shipped 2026-06-01)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `refunds.ts` — refund as new row (ADR-008), never mutate paid txn status; new `refund` approval kind (4-touchpoint pattern per CLAUDE.md §how-to-add-a-feature #8); on approval write the ledger (row + stock re-credit + audit) at `settlement_status: pending` (ADR-038) [`88470b0`]
- ✅ `markRefundSettled` mutation — manager flips `settlement_status` pending → settled after moving cash out-of-band; **manager-session gated, not manager-PIN** (the PIN gate is at refund approval; settling is a bookkeeping ack), second audit stamp (who settled, when) per ADR-038. No Xendit refund/disbursement API call in v1 [`88470b0`]
- ✅ `receipt.ts` — receipt token generation + public lookup + 24h cache; **purge cached HTML on refund commit** so the receipt re-projects refund state (ADR-039) [`88470b0`]
- ✅ Schema: `pos_refunds` (incl. `settlement_status` field — ADR-038) [`88470b0`]

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `routes/refund/[txnId].tsx` — refund flow (mgr-PIN gated via Telegram from v0.4) [`88470b0`]
- ✅ `routes/receipt/[receiptNumber].tsx` — public receipt page `/r/:n` (signed URL) [`97e0e92`]
- ✅ `rp()` negative-amount handling (v0.2 follow-up) [`88470b0`]

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ ADR-008 honoured (refunds as new rows, status computed on read) [`88470b0`]
- ✅ ADR-038 (refund settlement: POS is system-of-record, money moves manually in v1; `settlement_status` seam for v1.1 automated disbursements; `markRefundSettled` is manager-session-gated) — locked 2026-05-31
- ✅ ADR-039 (receipt-after-refund display contract — resolves staffreview Critical 2: refund re-projects the receipt not mutates it; cache purged on refund commit; original token stays valid; partial-refund lines preserved + annotated; settlement_status excluded from public receipt) — locked 2026-05-31
- ✅ SCHEMA.md audit enum: `refund.*` [`88470b0`]

### PR C — Housekeeping (shipped 2026-06-01)
- ✅ Shared `tokenHash` helper, `upsertStockLevel`, terminal-state config [`1e4388f`]

## v0.5.2 — FPOS-internal inventory slice ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** FPOS-internal inventory slice — stock-check screen, staff recount flow, reactive low-stock alerting to a new `inventory` Telegram group.
Merged 2026-06-01 via PR #12 (commit `23f4de1`). Builds on `pos_stock_movements` (already shipped v0.3); added `recount` source literal, two new tables (`pos_low_stock_alerts`, `pos_recount_state`), and the reactive low-stock check seam. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-v0.5.2-inventory.md`.

**You'll be able to:**
- See current stock levels per SKU at a glance on `/stock` (status: ok / low / negative)
- Submit absolute recounts on `/stock/recount` — system computes signed deltas and writes `recount` movements; managers see every recount via Telegram
- Drill into a SKU on `/stock/:skuId` for movement history; managers edit `low_threshold` from the detail view
- Get reactive low-stock alerts to the `inventory` Telegram group when on-hand crosses below threshold (SKU-deduped)
- Trust that every stock change has an audit trail — no silent number edits

**Still not yet:**
- Log FPro-driven stock-in/out — the kitchen → booth flow ships in v0.5.2b once the cross-deployment integration pattern lands
- Reconcile negative-stock-flagged transactions (ADR-018) from a manager view (v0.5.2b)
- View transaction history, see the dashboard, or reconcile settlements (v0.5.3)
- Manage staff or products in-app (v0.5.3)
- Track spoilage / wasted stock (v0.6)
- Rely on nightly auto-reconciliation of stock counts (v0.6)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `convex/inventory/` — `recordRecount` (action), `setLowThreshold` (manager mutation), `listInventory` / `getSkuDetail` / `getRecountState` (queries) [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ `convex/inventory/internal.ts` — `_checkLowStock_internal` (reactive check), `_dispatchLowStockAlert_internal` + `_dispatchRecountNotice_internal` (Telegram dispatch) [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ `convex/catalog/internal.ts` — `_getSkusByIds_internal` + `_setLowThreshold_internal` cross-module seams (ADR-034) [`23f4de1`]

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `routes/stock/index.tsx` — inventory list [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ `routes/stock/recount.tsx` — staff absolute recount flow [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ `routes/stock/[skuId].tsx` — SKU detail + manager threshold edit [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ Home screen — hourly recount-nudge banner [`23f4de1`]

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ [ADR-041](./ADR/041-recount-staff-absolute-stock-update.md) — recount vs adjust distinction [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ [ADR-042](./ADR/042-low-stock-detection-inventory-telegram.md) — reactive low-stock detection reuses catalog `low_threshold` [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ Schema: `pos_low_stock_alerts` + `pos_recount_state` tables; `pos_stock_movements.source` gains `recount` [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ SCHEMA.md audit enum: `stock.recount`, `stock.low_stock_alerted`, `stock.low_threshold_set` [`23f4de1`]
- ✅ New Telegram role `inventory` (in `KNOWN_TELEGRAM_ROLES`); bind via `/mgr/telegram-chats` post-deploy [`23f4de1`]

## v0.5.2b — FPro-driven stock-in/out 🗂️ BACKLOG
**Outcome:** Stock-in/out flow driven by Frollie Pro recipes/inventory once the cross-deployment integration pattern lands (ADR-043 to be drafted). FPro caller stubbed for v0.5.2; this phase wires the real integration.
**Target:** TBD
Plan not yet written. Tasks get added at planning time (per CLAUDE.md convention).

**You'll be able to:**
- Log stock-in by SKU through the app, driven by FPro recipe + inventory data
- Reconcile negative-stock-flagged transactions (ADR-018) from a manager view
- Trust that every stock change has an audit trail tied to the FPro source-of-truth

**Still not yet:**
- View transaction history, see the dashboard, or reconcile settlements (v0.5.3)
- Manage staff or products in-app (v0.5.3)
- Track spoilage / wasted stock (v0.6)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- 🗂️ `inventory/public.ts` extensions — stock-in mutations against existing `pos_stock_movements`, reconciliation queries
- 🗂️ FPro cross-deployment integration (per ADR-043, to be drafted) — replaces the v0.5.2 stub

### Frontend (`src/`)
- 🗂️ `routes/stock/in.tsx` — stock-in entry (with `NumericKeypad` qty input)
- 🗂️ Negative-stock reconciliation manager view

### Cross-cutting
- 🗂️ ADR-043 (to be drafted) — POS ↔ FPro cross-deployment integration pattern
- 🗂️ ADR-018 reconciliation tools (negative-stock manager workflow)

## v0.5.3a — Reporting (transaction history + manager dashboard) ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Read-mostly reporting slice. Staff see today's sales on `/history`; managers see any day plus the laptop-first `/mgr/dashboard`. Customer receipts re-shareable from history via `shareReceipt` — first real caller of the v0.5.1 dormant lazy-mint seam. Zero schema change.
**Target:** shipped 2026-06-01 on `feat/v0.5.3a-reporting`

**You'll be able to:**
- Open `/history` and see today's paid sales (staff) or any picked WIB day (manager picker)
- Tap a row to see snapshot lines + totals + payment method + refund badge
- Tap "Bagikan struk" to mint a `/r/<token>` URL and re-share a customer receipt
- Open `/mgr/dashboard` (manager-only) and see Totals, PaymentMix, NeedsAttention, TopSkus, HourlyCurve, VoucherUsage, PerStaff cards

**Still not yet:**
- Edit staff or product taxonomy in-app (v0.5.3)
- Configure the receipt template (v0.5.3)
- Reconcile Xendit settlements (v0.5.3)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `convex/transactions/lib.ts` — pure `computeDaySummary` aggregator + `DayTxn` / `DaySummary` / `Instrument` / `DayLine` types
- ✅ `convex/transactions/internal.ts::_fetchDayWindow_internal` — single day read powering the three reporting queries
- ✅ `convex/transactions/public.ts` — `listDayTransactions` / `dashboardSummary` / `getTransactionDetail` / `shareReceipt`
- ✅ `convex/auth/internal.ts::_resolveSessionRole_internal` — non-throwing resolve+role
- ✅ `convex/auth/internal.ts::_listStaffNames_internal` — projection for day-window staff-name labeling
- ✅ `convex/payments/internal.ts::_instrumentForTxn_internal` — ADR-034 normaliser returning qris / bca_va / unknown
- ✅ `convex/refunds/lib.ts::refundStatus` — extracted from receipt template; now shared by template + FE history badge
- ✅ `convex/lib/time.ts` — `WIB_OFFSET_MS` exported for the WIB-hour bucketing in the aggregator

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `src/routes/history/index.tsx` — list (manager date picker; staff today-only)
- ✅ `src/routes/history/$txnId.tsx` — detail + "Bagikan struk"
- ✅ `src/routes/mgr/dashboard.tsx` — 7 cards (manager-gated; non-manager sees "Hanya manajer")
- ✅ `src/router.tsx` — `/history/:txnId` lazy route registered

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ No new schema, indexes, or audit verbs — pure function over already-shipped tables
- ✅ Reuses `pos_transactions.by_status_created` for the day window
- ✅ Activates the dormant v0.5.1 `_lazyMintReceiptToken_internal` seam (first real caller)
- ✅ Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-01-v0.5.3a-reporting.md`

## v0.5.3b — In-app admin (staff + product CRUD + receipt config) ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Managers run booth admin from the POS — no Convex dashboard needed for daily ops. Tiered manager gate: PIN for identity/money writes (staff create/role/deactivate, product create/pricing), session for low-stakes config (rename, meta, components, archive, receipt branding). Receipt branding + uploaded logo configurable in-app; config change purges the receipt cache so customers see new branding on next view.
**Target:** shipped 2026-06-02 on `worktree-exec-v0.5.3b`

**You'll be able to:**
- Open `/mgr/staff` and create/rename/role-change/deactivate staff + reset their PIN, all in-app
- Open `/mgr/products` and create/edit/archive products, edit pricing (PIN-gated), and edit the inventory-SKU components linkage
- Open `/mgr/receipt` and edit receipt branding (business name, address, contact, IG handle, footer) + upload a logo with a live preview
- See `listStaff` no longer leak `pin_hash` (v0.2 follow-up cleanup)

**Still not yet:**
- Reconcile Xendit settlements (v0.5.3 — remaining backlog item from the v0.5.3 omnibus)
- Use vouchers / promo codes (v0.6)
- Track spoilage / wasted stock (v0.6)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `convex/auth/verifyPin.ts::verifyManagerPinOrThrow` — extracted helper; `resetStaffPin` refactored onto it (single manager-PIN funnel)
- ✅ `convex/staff/public.ts` — `listStaff` strips `pin_hash` (`_helpers.ts` projection); `createStaff` PIN-gated; `updateStaffName` (session)
- ✅ `convex/staff/actions.ts` — `setStaffRole`, `deactivateStaff` (both manager-PIN)
- ✅ `convex/catalog/public.ts` — `listAllProducts` admin query; `updateProductMeta`, `setProductComponents`, `archiveProduct` (manager-session)
- ✅ `convex/catalog/actions.ts` — `createProduct`, `updateProductPricing` (both manager-PIN)
- ✅ `convex/settings/public.ts` — `getReceiptConfig`, `updateReceiptConfig`, `generateLogoUploadUrl` (manager-session)
- ✅ `convex/receipts/internal.ts::_purgeAllReceiptCache_internal` — wired to fire on every receipt-config update
- ✅ `convex/receipts/template.ts` — reads branding from `pos_settings`; renders uploaded logo + configurable footer
- ✅ Six new optional `pos_settings` fields: `receipt_business_name`, `receipt_address`, `receipt_contact`, `receipt_instagram_handle`, `receipt_footer_text`, `receipt_logo_storage_id`
- ✅ New audit verbs (all `source=booth_inline`): `staff.updated`, `staff.deactivated`, `product.created`, `product.updated`, `product.archived`, `settings.receipt_updated`

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `src/routes/mgr/staff.tsx` — create / rename / role / deactivate / reset-PIN
- ✅ `src/routes/mgr/products.tsx` — CRUD + component linkage editor + pricing (PIN-gated)
- ✅ `src/routes/mgr/receipt.tsx` — branding form + logo upload + live preview

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ No new ADRs; slice extends existing tables (`pos_settings`, `staff`, `pos_products`, `pos_product_components`) and follows the established manager-PIN / manager-session gate pattern
- ✅ Backend additive; six new `pos_settings` fields are all optional (no migration)
- ✅ Receipt cache purged on first config write — minted receipts lazily re-render with new branding

## v0.5.3 — Manager dashboard + in-app admin + Xendit settlements 🗂️ BACKLOG
**Outcome:** Managers run daily ops from a laptop-first dashboard, edit staff/products in-app, configure the receipt template, view full transaction history, and reconcile Xendit settlements — closing the v1.0 settlement-risk register item.
**Target:** TBD
Plan not yet written. Closes the load-bearing "Xendit settlement timing" risk under watch (see Risks below).

**You'll be able to:**
- ✅ View transaction history (staff: own + today; manager: everything) — *shipped in v0.5.3a*
- ✅ Use the manager dashboard (laptop-first) for daily sales, top SKUs, flagged transactions, staff activity — *shipped in v0.5.3a*
- ✅ Add, edit, deactivate staff in-app — the Convex dashboard is no longer required — *shipped in v0.5.3b*
- ✅ Add, edit, archive products in-app — *shipped in v0.5.3b*
- ✅ Configure the receipt template (logo, footer text, contact info) from the manager portal — *shipped in v0.5.3b*
- Reconcile Xendit settlements (what they owe vs what they've paid out) — *remaining backlog*

**Still not yet:**
- Use vouchers / promo codes (v0.6)
- Track spoilage / wasted stock (v0.6)
- Launch in production with full operational polish (v1.0)

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ `dashboard.ts` equivalent — `transactions.dashboardSummary` shipped in v0.5.3a
- ✅ `settings/public.ts` — receipt config CRUD shipped in v0.5.3b
- ✅ `staff/public.ts` updates — `pin_hash` strip + admin mutations shipped in v0.5.3b
- ✅ `catalog/public.ts` + `actions.ts` admin mutations — products CRUD shipped in v0.5.3b
- 🗂️ `settlements.ts` — full reconciliation (Xendit settlement webhook + nightly recon) — load-bearing for v1.0 launch confidence per Risks under watch

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ `routes/history/*` — staff/manager history shipped in v0.5.3a
- ✅ `routes/mgr/dashboard.tsx` — shipped in v0.5.3a
- ✅ `routes/mgr/products.tsx` — shipped in v0.5.3b
- ✅ `routes/mgr/staff.tsx` — shipped in v0.5.3b
- ✅ `routes/mgr/receipt.tsx` — shipped in v0.5.3b
- 🗂️ `routes/settlements.tsx` — payout reconciliation

### Cross-cutting
- 🗂️ Schema additions: `pos_settlements`
- ✅ SCHEMA.md audit verbs: `staff.*`, `product.*`, `settings.receipt_updated` shipped in v0.5.3b; `settlement.*` still pending

## v0.5.4 — Bluetooth thermal receipt printing ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Staff print 58mm ESC/POS receipts to the EPPOS EP5811AI over Web Bluetooth — one tap on the sale-complete screen, a glanceable connect chip, and a test-print path. Fully client-side; QR on paper links to the booth's Instagram.
**Target:** 9-task SDD pipeline executed on branch `worktree-exec-v0.5.4` 2026-06-02; **printing verified working end-to-end on-device** (connect → print full paid receipt). Includes QA-driven refinements (Instagram QR, app-global shared connection + status dot, editable receipt content) and a pre-existing charge-flow guard fix. typecheck + build + 781 tests green. Deferred QA (non-blocking): refund/voucher receipt formatting, staff-scope, long-name wrap. Plan: PR #16, `f5d5bae`.
Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-bluetooth-thermal-printing.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-bluetooth-thermal-printing.md) · spec + 2× staffreview. Device verified on-device (dual-mode BLE, service `0x18f0` / write char `0x2af1`).

**You'll be able to:**
- Tap "Cetak struk" on charge-success and print a formatted 58mm receipt
- Connect the printer once at shift start (home/header chip), and it stays linked across every screen for the session; a status dot shows linked/not-linked at a glance
- Run a test print from the printer sheet with no active sale
- Hand the customer a paper receipt whose QR opens the booth's **Instagram** (from the `instagram_handle` setting)
- Edit receipt text (name / address / footer) at `/mgr/receipt` and have it flow straight to the printed receipt (blank fields skipped)

**Still not yet:**
- Printed Frollie logo image / raster receipts (fast-follow; text-mode v1 ignores `settings.logo_url`)
- Auto-print without a tap (later toggle)
- Reprint from the history screen (history-screen-dependent)
- iOS / non-Chrome printing (POS is Android-Chrome single-device)

### Backend (`convex/`)

## v0.5.5 — Inventory-SKU admin + route error boundary ✅ DONE
**Outcome:** Managers can create inventory SKUs in-app (standalone or bundled with a new product), closing the v0.5.3b scope gap where products could be created but SKUs were seed-only. The Add Product dialog gains a checkbox that atomically creates-or-links a matching SKU at an editable qty — one PIN entry for both the "Matcha 1pc" (qty 1, new SKU) and "Dubai 3pcs" (qty 3, existing SKU reused) cases. Stale-deploy chunk-load failures auto-recover via a one-shot guarded reload across the app shell AND the three customer-/manager-facing public routes, replacing React Router's default error screen with a branded fallback (Indonesian on `/r/*`).
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-v0.5.5-inventory-sku-admin-and-error-boundary-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-v0.5.5-inventory-sku-admin-and-error-boundary-design.md) (2× staffreview-validated)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-v0.5.5-inventory-sku-admin-and-error-boundary.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-v0.5.5-inventory-sku-admin-and-error-boundary.md) (staffreview-validated; 12 tasks)
**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- (Manager) Tap "Add SKU" on `/mgr/products`, enter slug + name + threshold, confirm PIN — the new SKU appears in the components dropdown immediately
- (Manager) Tick "Also create or link a matching inventory SKU" when adding a product — the same PIN entry creates the SKU (or reuses an existing one with the matching slug) AND links the component at the qty you set
- (Manager) Add "Dubai 3pcs" linked to the existing `dubai` SKU at qty 3 without a duplicate-SKU error — the slug match triggers a reuse, not a collision
- (Anyone) See a friendly "Reload" screen instead of a React Router stack trace when the open tab loads a stale chunk after a deploy
- (Customer) Open a receipt link from Telegram and see Indonesian "Halaman tidak bisa dimuat. Buka ulang link dari Telegram." instead of the default error screen if the chunk is stale

**Still not yet:**
- Edit / deactivate / archive an inventory SKU from the UI (create-only this phase)
- Set SKU `code` / `initials` / `hue` from the bundled-checkbox flow (use standalone Add SKU for those — the bundled dialog deliberately stays minimal)
- Off-booth Telegram-approval flow for SKU creation (booth-only this phase; no new KIND added)
- Per-route fallback variants beyond the `useLocation` Indonesian/English split (ADR-045 caps coverage at the four shells today)

## v0.5.6 — Admin wiring + receipt/refund UX ✅ SHIPPED (`ad8888b`, 2026-06-05)
**Outcome:** Four UX/admin gaps from the prod cutover close — all pure UI wiring of already-built backend (no schema, no migration): staff change their own PIN in-app, a manager mints a device setup-code without the CLI, history detail reprints an earlier sale, and the refund flow finally has a door.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-v0.5.6-admin-wiring-and-receipt-refund-ux-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-03-v0.5.6-admin-wiring-and-receipt-refund-ux-design.md) (spec-gate staffreview passed)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-v0.5.6-admin-wiring.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-03-v0.5.6-admin-wiring.md) (plan-gate staffreview: Approve; assumptions verified vs code)
**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- (Staff) Change your own PIN in-app from a "Change PIN" tile → `/account` (closes the sole-manager `1111` dead-end)
- (Manager) Mint a 6-digit device setup-code from `/mgr/device-setup` (code + expiry countdown + regenerate) and register a 2nd device with no CLI
- (Staff) Reprint an earlier sale's receipt from history detail — same bytes as charge-success (reuses the v0.5.4 printer stack)
- (Staff) Start a refund from the transaction that needs it (per-txn button on history) or from a "Refund" home tile → the existing `/refund` list

**Still not yet:**
- Active-device list + device deactivate (deferred — would need a new backend mutation; keeps the phase backend-free)
- Refund *logic* changes (the flow is v0.5.1b; this only adds the entrance)
- A general settings/profile IA (Part A is one entry point, not a settings section)

## v0.5.7 — Telegram /activatepos device activation ✅ DONE
**Outcome:** A manager brings a new device online from anywhere — `/activatepos` in the managers Telegram chat replies with a fresh 6-digit setup code.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-telegram-activatepos-command-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-telegram-activatepos-command-design.md) (spec-gate staffreview: Revise → Critical-1 + 3 improvements addressed)

**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- (Manager) Send `/activatepos` in the managers chat → 6-digit setup code, expiry, activation link — no session
- Activate a new device with that code via the existing `/activate` flow — even with nobody logged in
- Trust the code stays single-use, 1h TTL, and audited, gated to the `managers`-role chat

**Still not yet:**
- Per-person Telegram→staff attribution (records the Telegram chat title + sender id only; no staff-mapping table)
- Rate-limiting on issuance (single-use + 1h TTL + audit is the v1 guard)
- Device deactivation / active-device management (unchanged; out of scope)

### Backend (`convex/`)

## v0.5.7.1 — useSession transient-null fix Option B (issue #44) 🗂️ SUPERSEDED BY v0.5.9
**⚠️ SUPERSEDED 2026-06-06 — DO NOT EXECUTE.** The transient-null hypothesis this phase was built on was empirically **refuted** by PR #48 instrumentation (Playwright run `27021101339`): `validation === null` with `stored=Y` never appears post-login. The real root cause was a11y/selector drift (catalog `Add` labels, Radix Tabs role, bare `<Label>` siblings) and shipped in **v0.5.9** (`ae225ef`, closes #44). Full trail: [`docs/postmortems/2026-06-issue-44-misdiagnosis.md`](./postmortems/2026-06-issue-44-misdiagnosis.md). Tasks below are struck (🗂️) — kept for historical context, not for work.

**Outcome (original, refuted):** A bug-only fast follow that replaces `useSession`'s "any null means dead" interpretation with evidence-based detection: a `null` from `useQuery(getSession)` is only treated as authoritative after we've successfully validated the current `sessionId` at least once (tracked via a `useRef` keyed on `stored`, so a same-instance lock+relogin resets the evidence). Real users no longer get bounced to `/login` after a reload; the 6 PIN-gated e2e specs `test.skip`-ed in PR #43 run un-skipped on CI; `RootLayout` gets a 5-second "Stuck on loading?" escape hatch for the rare genuinely-stale-localStorage case.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-useSession-transient-null-fix-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-useSession-transient-null-fix-design.md) (spec-gate staffreview: Revise → 1 Critical + 2 Improvements folded in; relogin-safe ref shape is canonical)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-issue-44-usesession-transient-null-fix.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-05-issue-44-usesession-transient-null-fix.md) (plan-gate staffreview: Revise → 1 Critical + 3 Improvements addressed; assumptions verified vs code)
**Architectural-options review:** [`docs/reviews/staffreview-issue-44-architectural-options-2026-06-05.md`](./reviews/staffreview-issue-44-architectural-options-2026-06-05.md) — supersedes the Option A debounce plan that landed in PR #45 (same filename).
**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- Hard-reload any signed-in route (or do a Playwright `page.goto`) without getting bounced to `/login`
- See a brief `Loading…` flash during the WS resubscribe window instead of a redirect — the hook now requires evidence ("I've validated this sessionId at least once") before trusting a `null`
- Recover from a stuck-on-loading state via a 5-second "Stuck on loading? Lock device and sign in again." escape hatch in `RootLayout` (rare; for cases where the server reaper deleted the session row while the device was idle)
- Un-skip the 6 PIN-gated e2e specs (refund, sale-bca-va, sale-qris, spoilage, voucher-offline, voucher-online) — CI runs all 8 specs

**Still not yet:**
- A backend-side fix to `getSession`'s null-ambiguity at the API boundary (Option D from the architectural review — tagged-union return shape; filed as a follow-up issue, parked until a second motivating query exists)
- An audit of `useApproval` and other `useQuery`-driven hooks with the same destructive null-handling shape (filed as a follow-up issue)
- A user-facing "Session reconnecting…" banner (the loading state + escape hatch is enough)
- Investigating whether Convex itself should preserve last-known values across WS reconnect (potential upstream issue, out of v1 scope)

### Frontend (`src/`)

- 🗂️ **[v0571-fe-verify-hypothesis]** Throwaway instrumentation in `useSession.ts` + draft-PR CI pass — confirm `validation === null` actually appears between post-login `page.goto` and the `/login` redirect; strip after one signal. Kept as defence-in-depth even under Option B — if the symptom is actually `validation === undefined` throughout, the bug has a different root cause that the Option B render-time branch only partially helps with.

## v0.5.8 — Orphaned-function wiring ✅ DONE
**Outcome:** Three tested-but-doorless backend functions get their UI — the same "backend exists, no entrance" gap v0.5.6 closed. Mostly pure FE wiring; one tiny additive backend change (audit query pre-derives actor names). No schema, no migration. (Renumbered from v0.5.7, which the Telegram /activatepos phase claimed first.)
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-v0.5.8-orphan-wiring-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-v0.5.8-orphan-wiring-design.md) (spec-gate staffreview: resolved Part C to manager-gated/refund-only)

**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- (Manager) Browse the append-only audit trail from `/mgr/audit` — reverse-chron rows with server-derived actor names, an action filter, and "Load more"
- (Staff) See a home banner when a payment was left in-flight (last 5 min) and tap to resume its charge screen — recovers a webhook that landed while the app was closed
- (Manager) Cancel a pending refund-approval request from the inline waiting screen, instead of waiting out the 60-min token expiry

**Still not yet:**
- Staff-requester self-cancel of their own pending approval (would need a new backend mutation — deferred; non-managers still rely on expiry/denial/sale-abandon)
- A cancel button on the charge screen (near-redundant with the existing sale-abandon cascade-deny — out of scope)
- Surfacing `mgr_approver_id` / richer audit columns (action filter is text-only in v0.5.8)

## v0.5.9 — e2e Stabilization (issue #44 actual fix) ✅ SHIPPED (`ae225ef`, 2026-06-06)
**Outcome:** Land the actual fix for issue #44 — a11y / selector drift on catalog `Add` buttons (three "Dubai" SKUs all rendered identical `Add Dubai` labels) + Radix `TabsTrigger` role (`role="tab"` not `button`) + bare `<Label>` siblings without `htmlFor`. Un-skip the 6 PIN-gated e2e specs that have been red since PR #43 (refund, sale-qris, sale-bca-va, spoilage, voucher-online, voucher-offline). Drop the `e2e/fixtures.ts` 1500ms warm-up (refuted mitigation). Document the misdiagnosis trail in a new `docs/postmortems/` dir and install an evidence-before-mitigation gate into the global staffreview skill so the next misdiagnosis is caught at plan-review time. 4 slices, single PR, no Convex changes.

**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- (CI) Run all 8 e2e specs un-skipped — auth + refund + sale-qris + sale-bca-va + spoilage + voucher-online + voucher-offline (honest re-skip with body deleted) + the existing happy path
- (a11y) Hear screen readers announce "Add Dubai 1 pc" / "Add Dubai 3 pcs" / "Add Dubai 8 pcs" instead of three identical "Add Dubai" buttons
- (a11y) Tab from a `<Label>` to its paired `<Input>` / `<SelectTrigger>` on every form on `/mgr/spoilage` and `/mgr/vouchers` (htmlFor + id wired through Radix)
- (review) Get caught by the new staffreview §4.9 Evidence-Before-Mitigation Gate before shipping another timing/warm-up "fix" without instrumentation evidence
- (process) Find post-incident retrospectives in `docs/postmortems/` (distinct from `docs/reviews/` pre-merge artifacts) — first entry is the issue #44 misdiagnosis trail

**Still not yet:**
- Convex backend changes — this phase is pure FE/e2e/docs (closes #44 / #49 / #50)
- ESLint rule to enforce the SKIP-comment three-field template at CI time (optional follow-up; deferred until pattern is ignored in practice)
- Seed-side change to expose stable test IDs for `voucher-offline.spec.ts` (filed as follow-up at PR-open time; until it ships, ADR-009 offline-voucher rejection stays covered by unit tests only)

### Cross-cutting

- ✅ **[v0.5.9-xc-radix-select-smoke]** Task 0 verification gate — temporary throwaway probe spec (`e2e/specs/_probe.spec.ts`) + staged-but-uncommitted edit to `src/routes/mgr/vouchers.tsx` to test whether Playwright `page.getByLabel(/Type/i).click()` forwards through `<label htmlFor>` to a Radix `<SelectTrigger role="combobox">` and opens the dropdown. Records `TASK 0 RESULT: YES/NO` inline in the plan; all throwaway artefacts reverted in Step 5. PASS → Tasks 5-7 / 9 use `getByLabel`; FAIL → use pre-authorized `getByRole("combobox", { name: /Type/i })` fallback. No commit. (ae225ef)

  - **notes:**
    - _Pure investigation step — produces no commit; gates selector strategy for downstream un-skip tasks._
    - 2026-06-06: probe SKIPPED — used plan's pre-authorized fallback `getByRole("combobox", { name: /Type/i })` in `voucher-online.spec.ts` instead. Task 4's htmlFor wiring gives the Radix combobox an accessible name via `aria-labelledby`, so the fallback resolves unambiguously without needing the headed-Playwright probe.

- ✅ **[v0.5.9-xc-drop-warmup]** `e2e/fixtures.ts:37-41` — delete the `await page.waitForTimeout(1500)` + the 4-line workaround-comment block above it. PR #48 instrumentation (run `27021101339`) refuted the session-loss-on-hard-nav hypothesis empirically. The warm-up is dead weight; worktree branched off `48615b7` predates PR #48's `b644d6a` drop so it's still present here. (ae225ef)

## v0.6 — vouchers + spoilage + nightly stock-recon + Playwright ✅ SHIPPED (`2c0133c`, 2026-06-03) — e2e coverage partial
**Outcome:** Manager-portal voucher CRUD with ADR-009 offline reject banner; spoilage at booth (manager-PIN) or off-booth (Telegram approval); nightly cron rebuilds `pos_stock_levels` from the movements ledger and alerts on drift (report-only, no silent correction); first Playwright E2E suite proving the transactional golden path.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-v0.6-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-v0.6-design.md) (staffreview-validated)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-v0.6.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-v0.6.md) (staffreview-validated; 41 tasks across 5 waves)
**Target:** Shipped 2026-06-03 (PR #25, squash `2c0133c`). Backend + FE complete; e2e suite scaffolded but 6/7 specs quarantined (see Wave 4 note). Post-merge code-review follow-ups tracked below.

**You'll be able to:**
- (Manager) Create % or amount vouchers from `/mgr/vouchers` with PIN, edit meta without PIN, deactivate, see redemption history with receipt numbers
- (Staff) Apply a voucher offline against the cached list and either commit cleanly OR see a clear ADR-009 banner if the voucher expired/deactivated between cart-build and payment
- (Manager) Log multi-SKU spoilage at the booth with PIN, OR request via Telegram with a single-use approval URL — both paths converge on one ledger writer
- Watch the nightly 02:00 WIB cron rebuild `on_hand` from `pos_stock_movements` and Telegram-alert the `inventory` role if any SKU drifts
- (DevX/CI) ✅ **Full coverage (as of v0.6.1):** all 7 e2e specs active, 0 skipped — `auth`, `sale-qris`, `sale-bca-va`, `voucher-online`, `voucher-offline`, `refund`, `spoilage`. The 6 quarantined specs were un-skipped in v0.6.1 Wave B after fixing three real, evidenced causes (C1 Xendit simulate-id mismatch, C2 seed stable test IDs, C3 spoilage submit-disable). See triage doc `docs/postmortems/2026-06-issue-43-e2e-skip-triage.md`. CI workflow (`e2e.yml`) runs `playwright test` unfiltered — no per-spec allowlist.

**Still not yet:**
- `stock_in` and manager `adjustment` mutations (deferred — not in v0.6 scope per the explicit decomposition)
- Voucher stacking (ADR-010 — permanent decision)
- Line-level vouchers (ADR-024)
- Silent drift auto-correction (ADR-044 — permanent decision, report-only by design)
- Production launch with operational polish (v1.0)

### Post-merge follow-ups (retrospective code review, 2026-06-07)

- ✅ **[v06-fu-actioncache-authcheck]** Action-cache pre-cache authCheck — `convex/idempotency/action.ts` → **delivered in v0.6.1 Wave A** (1a4c8b6)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert` · **deps:** `none`
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: Review found `withActionCache` does the idempotency cache lookup BEFORE any auth (`action.ts:39`); systemic across all 7 PIN-gated admin actions (v0.5.3b pattern), NOT v0.6-introduced. **Carried into v0.6.1 Wave A** (required pre-cache authCheck + ADR-046) — see the v0.6.1 phase below.
    - 2026-06-09: Delivered via v0.6.1 Wave A (ADR-046 pre-cache authCheck); see v0.6.1 phase.
- ✅ **[v06-fu-voucher-shared-helper]** Route BE `validateVoucher` + `commitCart` through `convex/lib/voucherValidate.ts` (e2b1184)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert` · **deps:** `none`
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: Done in PR #56 (`e2b1184`). Both BE paths now delegate to the shared V8-safe `validateVoucherAgainst`; the two inline copies are gone.
- ✅ **[v06-fu-spoilage-comment-fix]** Fix stale `KIND_AUDIT` comment — `convex/approvals/kinds.ts:139` (e2b1184)
  - **agent:** `—` · **deps:** `none`
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: Done in PR #56 (`e2b1184`). Comment now reads `"stock.spoilage"`.
- ✅ **[v06-fu-e2e-unskip]** Un-skip the 6 quarantined Playwright specs → **delivered in v0.6.1 Wave B** (1a4c8b6)
  - **agent:** `general-purpose` · **deps:** `none`
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: The #43 "hard-nav session loss" label is a mis-attribution — the per-spec skip headers document **three** unrelated causes (C1 Xendit simulate id mismatch ×4, C2 seed test IDs ×1, C3 spoilage submit-disable ×1). **Carried into v0.6.1 Wave B** (per-cluster, evidence-gated) — see the v0.6.1 phase below.
    - 2026-06-09: Delivered via v0.6.1 Wave B (per-cluster, evidence-gated); see v0.6.1 phase.
- 📋 **[v06-fu-collapse-mgr-session-resolve]** Collapse double manager-session resolve across the 8 PIN-gated admin actions
  - **agent:** `convex-expert` · **deps:** `v061-be-actioncache-authcheck` · **docs:** none
  - [ ] Thread the pre-cache `assertManagerSessionInAction` resolution forward so `verifyManagerPinOrThrow` reuses it instead of re-resolving the same session (drops 2–4 RPC hops/call)
  - [ ] Preserve the auth-before-cache ordering + resolution-parity invariant (ADR-046)
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: surfaced by v0.6.1 /simplify (efficiency) + triple-review (architecture I1) — both flagged non-blocking. resetStaffPin resolves the session 3×; all 8 callers double-resolve. Deferred to avoid refactoring the auth funnel at ship time.
- 📋 **[v06-fu-shared-auth-error-humanizer]** Extract shared auth-error humanizer (6 mgr route mappers duplicate auth/session/PIN branches)
  - **agent:** `frontend-integrator` · **deps:** `none` · **docs:** none
  - [ ] Add a shared `humanizeAuthError` (in `src/lib/errors.ts`, which already exposes `errorMessage`) covering NOT_MANAGER / MANAGER_SESSION_REQUIRED / MANAGER_ONLY / SESSION_INVALID / NO_SESSION / INVALID_PIN / LOCKED_OUT
  - [ ] Refactor the 6 `src/routes/mgr/*.tsx` `humanize*Error` fns to compose it, keeping each route's domain-specific branches; reconcile the divergent copy as a deliberate product choice
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-07: surfaced by v0.6.1 /simplify (reuse HIGH + altitude) — adding MANAGER_SESSION_REQUIRED was a 6-file touch. Deferred: consolidation unifies 3 intentionally-divergent copy strings (a product decision), out of v0.6.1 scope.

## v0.6.1 — admin-action auth hardening + e2e un-skip ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Every PIN-gated admin action rejects a non-manager/expired session BEFORE the idempotency cache lookup (closing a cached-result replay gap, ADR-046), and the 6 quarantined Playwright specs are un-skipped by fixing their three real, evidenced causes — proving the transactional golden path on CI.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-v0.6.1-admin-auth-hardening-e2e-unskip-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-07-v0.6.1-admin-auth-hardening-e2e-unskip-design.md) (staffreview-validated)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-07-v0.6.1-auth-hardening-e2e.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-07-v0.6.1-auth-hardening-e2e.md) (staffreview-validated; Wave A + Wave B clusters)
**Target:** TBD

**You'll be able to:**
- Trust that a leaked `idempotencyKey` can't replay a cached admin-action result without a live manager session (parity with the mutation-side rule #20)
- (DevX/CI) Run the QRIS/BCA-VA/refund/voucher/spoilage golden-path specs green on CI instead of `test.skip`

**Still not yet:**
- The empty lockout-test stub (`auth.spec.ts:24`) — separate follow-up (Sonner toast race; needs `[data-locked]` signal)
- Any new e2e coverage beyond the existing 6 specs

## v0.7 — Xendit settlement reconciliation ✅ SHIPPED
**Outcome:** Staff and managers can see, per day, what Xendit actually paid out to the booth's BCA account — closing the last load-bearing pre-launch risk ("Xendit settlement timing"). A manager can record a settlement day by hand (the verified path while Xendit KYB is pending); a nightly auto-poll of Xendit's transaction ledger is built and shape-tested, with live-verification gated behind KYB.
**Spec:** [`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-v0.7-xendit-settlement-reconciliation-design.md`](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-08-v0.7-xendit-settlement-reconciliation-design.md) (spec-gate staffreview: Approve; 4 improvements folded)
**Plan:** [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-v0.7-settlement-reconciliation.md`](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-08-v0.7-settlement-reconciliation.md) (plan-gate staffreview: Approve; 3 improvements folded; assumptions verified vs code)
**Shipped:** 8 Jun 2026 (squash-merge `643a188`, PR #67). Task-0 live-API gate corrected the Xendit shape (fee-object/no-settlement_date/cashflow); triple-review (0 Critical) + simplify(xhigh) folded; 991 tests green. KYB live-verification follow-up: [#66](https://github.com/lucasyhzhu-debug/frolliePOS/issues/66). Post-impl staffreview: [`docs/reviews/staffreview-worktree-v0.7-settlements-2026-06-08.md`](./reviews/staffreview-worktree-v0.7-settlements-2026-06-08.md).

**You'll be able to:**
- Open `/settlements` and see each payout day — net into BCA, gross, Xendit fee (MDR), and transaction count (visible to staff and managers, ADR-012)
- (Manager) Record a settlement day by hand from the Xendit dashboard figures — PIN-gated, audited, with the net computed for you (the verified launch path)
- Trust the nightly auto-poll will fill settlements in automatically once Xendit KYB clears — built and shape-tested now, flipped on later

**Still not yet:**
- Match each settled payout back to the exact transactions that made it up (v1.0 "settlement polish")
- Get a variance alert when collected ≠ settled (v1.0 "settlement polish")
- See live settlement figures from the auto-poll — blocked on Xendit KYB (TEST keys produce no real settlements); manual entry covers the gap until then
- Sync settlement data to Frollie Pro (v1.1)

## v1.0 — launch polish ✅ DONE
**Outcome:** The POS replaces the manual paper system at the booth, in production, with an operational runbook.
**Target:** 2026-06-12 (launch day) · **Shipped:** 2026-06-12 (tag `v1.0.0` @ 749d186 — live Rp 1.000 QRIS smoke test passed; paper system retired)
[Spec](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-v1.0-launch-polish-design.md) · [Plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-12-v1.0-launch-polish.md) · staffreviews: [spec](./reviews/staffreview-v1.0-launch-polish-spec-2026-06-12.md), [plan](./reviews/staffreview-v1.0-launch-polish-plan-2026-06-12.md)

**You'll be able to:**
- Run the POS in production on `savory-zebra-800` Convex (separate from dev)
- Have staff cleanly install the PWA via Android Chrome "Add to Home Screen"
- See proper empty + error states across every screen — no blank screens, no cryptic failures
- Lean on an operational runbook (oncall rotation, dashboards, alert thresholds) when things break
- **Retire the paper system at the booth — Frollie POS is live**

**Still not yet (deliberately out of scope for v1):**
- Multi-stall expansion — schema is single-tenant in v1
- Cash handling — digital payments only, by design (ADR-006)
- Customer-facing screens — staff + manager only
- Recipe / kitchen inventory — finished goods only
- Receipt printer hardware — decision pending; could land here or v1.1
- Cross-deployment integration with Frollie Pro `product_master` — decision pending; v1.1+

## v1.0.1 — launch-day ops observability 🚧 PLANNED
**Outcome:** During a production run you can watch every sale land in real time and get pushed an alert the moment anything breaks — then hot-fix it on a sanctioned fast lane.
**Target:** 2026-06-18 (next production runs)
[Spec](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-launch-ops-observability-design.md) · [Plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md) · staffreviews: [spec](./reviews/staffreview-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability-2026-06-17.md), [plan](./reviews/staffreview-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability-plan-2026-06-17.md)

**You'll be able to:**
- See every paid sale stream into the Managers Telegram group as a live ticker (receipt #, total, items, staff, instrument)
- Get a push alert in a new Frollie · Ops Telegram channel the moment a crash, payment failure, or backend error happens — instead of waiting for a staffer to phone you
- Flip the ticker off after launch via a settings toggle (`pos_settings.txn_ticker_enabled`)
- Follow a written hot-fix protocol (smoke checklist → fast-lane deploy → rollback) when something breaks mid-run

**Still not yet (deliberately out of scope):**
- A custom `/mgr/ops` live dashboard — Telegram push + Convex Logs cover one booth-day (v-next)
- Retry/persistence of failed Telegram alerts — fire-and-forget, audited-and-dropped (no retry storm)
- Refund ticker — paid sales only this slice

### Backend (`convex/`)
- ✅ **[v101-be-ops-ingest]** `convex/ops/` — error-ingest pipe: `pos_error_reports` table + pure signature/dedup lib + `_recordError_internal` (dedup + storm-cap) + `POST /ops/error` httpAction + `ops` Telegram role (5db3fc7)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Tasks 1–4, 7](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `pos_error_reports` schema + root compose + `txn_ticker_enabled` field
    - [x] `ops/lib.ts` pure `errorSignature`/`normalizeMessage`/`truncate` (+ tests)
    - [x] `_recordError_internal` dedup (5min) + storm-cap (10s) (+ tests)
    - [x] `ops` role in `KNOWN_TELEGRAM_ROLES`
    - [x] `/ops/error` httpAction — constant-time token, always 2xx (+ tests)
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
- ✅ **[v101-be-error-alerts]** `system_error` template + `sendErrorAlert` action + backend reporting on payment action & webhook (auth-path only) (ad7e22c)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v101-be-ops-ingest`
  - **docs:** [Plan Tasks 5, 6, 11](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `renderSystemError` + `system_error` kind/payload in `sendTemplate` (+ escape test)
    - [x] `sendErrorAlert({reportId})` action — narrow-catch role resolve, idempotency = reportId
    - [x] `requestPayment`/`retryWithFreshInvoice` best-effort report (rethrow preserved)
    - [x] webhook auth-path-only report; 401 path NOT reported (regression test)
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
- ✅ **[v101-be-sales-ticker]** `txn_ticker` template + `txn_ticker_enabled` read-default + `sendTxnTicker` action + once-per-sale hook in `_confirmPaid_internal` (54ee43e)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** `v101-be-error-alerts`
  - **docs:** [Plan Tasks 5, 8, 9, 10](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `renderTxnTicker` (line truncation) + `txn_ticker` kind/payload + optional `disableNotification`
    - [x] `_getSettings_internal` default `txn_ticker_enabled: true`
    - [x] `_getTxnForTicker_internal` + `sendTxnTicker` (SILENT skip, NO skip-audit; reuse `_getPaidInvoiceForTxn_internal`/`_listStaffNames_internal`)
    - [x] schedule ticker at `_confirmPaid_internal` tail (exactly-once re-fire test)
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

### Frontend (`src/`)
- ✅ **[v101-fe-error-reporter]** `src/lib/reportOps.ts` (`opsEndpoint` .cloud→.site + resilient `fetch` keepalive) wired at 4 sites: global handlers, `RouteErrorBoundary`, payment path, sale-flow mutation (4bca9bf)
  - **agent:** `frontend-integrator`
  - **deps:** `v101-be-ops-ingest`
  - **docs:** [Plan Tasks 12–13](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] `opsEndpoint` suffix-swap (+ test) + `reportOps` (never-throws, client dedup, `keepalive`)
    - [x] `window.onerror`/`unhandledrejection` global handlers (skip `isChunkLoadError`)
    - [x] `RouteErrorBoundary` reports genuine crash only (chunk-load skipped)
    - [x] payment-path + sale-commit catch wiring (scoped, not blanket)
  - **notes:**
    - 2026-06-18: payment-path catch wired in `src/routes/sale/charge.tsx` (the real Xendit create catch), not `useXenditPayment.ts` (query-only, no catch) — anticipated by plan verify-first. Sale-commit catch = `handleCharge` in `src/routes/sale/index.tsx` (commitCart for charge intent only; draft-save not wrapped).

### Cross-cutting
- ✅ **[v101-xc-runbook-docs]** RUNBOOK §9 (smoke checklist + sanctioned hot-fix protocol + rollback) + §5 env vars + SCHEMA + CLAUDE role table + CHANGELOG (bab578d)
  - **agent:** `claude`
  - **deps:** `v101-be-sales-ticker`, `v101-fe-error-reporter`
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 14](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.0.1-launch-ops-observability.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [x] RUNBOOK §9 live-run ops + hot-fix + rollback
    - [x] RUNBOOK §5 `OPS_INGEST_TOKEN`/`VITE_OPS_INGEST_TOKEN` (dev+prod, before FE deploy)
    - [x] SCHEMA `pos_error_reports` + `txn_ticker_enabled`; RUNBOOK-telegram + CLAUDE role table `ops`
    - [x] CHANGELOG v1.0.1 entry
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

## v1.0.2 — post-launch hardening 🗂️ BACKLOG
**Outcome:** The launch-day deferrals: full-route polish, real-device e2e, settlement live-verification, manager in-app sales-ticker toggle (`txn_ticker_enabled` write — v1.0.1 ships dashboard-only kill-switch).
**Target:** TBD
Plan not yet written. Tasks get IDs at planning time.

**You'll be able to:**
- See proper empty/error states on every remaining route (`mgr/*`, settlements, account, approve)
- Trust a full e2e pass on the real booth Android
- See settlement auto-poll live-verified once Xendit KYB clears ([#66](https://github.com/lucasyhzhu-debug/frolliePOS/issues/66))

### Backend (`convex/`)
- 🗂️ Settlement reconciliation polish (variance detection, alerts; per-transaction match-back N1; auto-poll **live-verification** once Xendit KYB clears — [#66](https://github.com/lucasyhzhu-debug/frolliePOS/issues/66))

### Frontend (`src/`)
- 🗂️ Full-route empty/error pass (`mgr/*`, settlements, account, approve)
- 🗂️ PWA install prompt polish (Android Chrome A2HS UX)
- 🗂️ Unreachable-stub cleanup (`/receipt`, `/wait`)
- ~~Universal route-error framing~~ — **shipped v0.5.5** as `RouteErrorBoundary` (`src/components/layout/RouteErrorBoundary.tsx`, wired in `router.tsx`)

### Cross-cutting
- 🗂️ Full e2e pass on real Android device
- 🗂️ Spare-device protocol (single-device SPOF — risk register)
- 🗂️ Operational runbook expansion (oncall rotation, dashboards, alert thresholds — booth basics shipped in v1.0 RUNBOOK §7)

## v1.1 — security hardening 📋 PLANNED
**Outcome:** Auth, money, and data seams are closed against the audit's High/Medium findings — no PIN brute-force, fabricated stock, default password, or cross-day leaks.
**Target:** TBD (planned 2026-06-17; execution post-/clear)
[Audit](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md) · [Spec](./superpowers/specs/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening-design.md) · [Plan](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md) · staffreviews: [spec](./reviews/staffreview-v1.1-security-hardening-spec-2026-06-17.md), [plan](./reviews/staffreview-v1.1-security-hardening-plan-2026-06-17.md)

**You'll be able to:**
- Trust the booth tablet's PINs can't be brute-forced — lockout is no longer bypassable (SEC-01)
- Trust that no staff action can fabricate inventory or post a negative-total sale (SEC-02)
- Ship a fresh deployment without a known default manager password baked in (SEC-03)
- Trust a leaked Telegram approval link can't lock managers out, and activation codes can't be brute-forced (SEC-04, SEC-07)
- Trust that one staffer can't read another day's sales or lift a receipt's signed-URL secret (SEC-05, SEC-06)

**Still not yet (deferred to a later hardening pass):**
- The 5 Low + 2 Info findings (SEC-08..SEC-14) — independent, lower-risk; tracked in the audit doc

### Backend (`convex/`)
- 📋 **[v11-be-cart-qty-guard]** `transactions/public.ts` — reject non-positive/fractional cart quantities at the commitCart boundary (SEC-02)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 1](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md), [audit SEC-02](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] Failing test: qty -1/0/1.5 + mixed positive/negative cart → `QTY_INVALID`, no `pos_transactions`/`pos_stock_movements` rows
    - [ ] `Number.isInteger(qty) && qty > 0` guard after `EMPTY_CART` (mirrors `_recordSpoilage_internal`)
    - [ ] Tests pass
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
- 📋 **[v11-be-bootstrap-pin]** `seed/actions.ts` + `auth/schema.ts` — env `BOOTSTRAP_MANAGER_PIN` (no default 1111) + soft `must_change_pin` (SEC-03)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 2](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md), [audit SEC-03](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] `must_change_pin` schema field (optional, backward-safe)
    - [ ] `bootstrap` throws `BOOTSTRAP_PIN_REQUIRED` when env unset; seeds with env PIN + flag
    - [ ] `_changePinCommit_internal` clears the flag; `getSession` exposes it; FE forced-rotation prompt
    - [ ] Tests pass
  - **notes:**
    - Does NOT retroactively protect live prod (bootstrap is one-time) — live S-0001 hardened only by the operational rotation in the handoff pre-flight
- 📋 **[v11-be-auth-counter-decouple]** `auth/internal.ts` + `verifyPin.ts` + `approvals/actions.ts` — decouple PIN-lockout counter from client idempotencyKey; off-booth approve no longer pollutes booth lockout (SEC-01 + SEC-07, atomic)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 3](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md), [audit SEC-01/SEC-07](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] Migrate `auth.test.ts:261` "Fix 10" test to the new increment-always contract
    - [ ] Drop `withIdempotency` wrap + `idempotencyKey` arg; add `countTowardLockout`; key on `staff_id`
    - [ ] Sweep all 6 callers (verifyPin.ts + 5 approvals sites)
    - [ ] SEC-01 + SEC-07 regression tests (booth locks; Telegram path doesn't lock booth)
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
- 📋 **[v11-be-activation-throttle]** `staff/public.ts` + `auth/schema.ts` + `staff/internal.ts` — throttle `activateDevice` (per-device + global-window block) + setup-code TTL 1h→15min (SEC-04)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 5](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md), [audit SEC-04](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] `pos_device_activation_attempts` table (per-device + `__global__` singleton)
    - [ ] Device-lock pre-check + increment; global breach blocks the window (does NOT wipe pending — I1)
    - [ ] Shorten `SETUP_CODE_TTL_MS` to 15min; sync docs
    - [ ] Tests pass
  - **notes:** _(empty)_

### Frontend (`src/`)
- _(FE work is folded into the cross-cutting read-seam task — `useXenditPayment` session threading + the `must_change_pin` prompt under `v11-be-bootstrap-pin`.)_

### Cross-cutting
- 📋 **[v11-xc-readseam-idor]** `transactions/public.ts` + `payments/public.ts` + `useXenditPayment.ts` — session-gate `getById`/`getCurrentInvoice` (+ internal variants for system callers) and strip `receipt_token` from the public seam (SEC-05 + SEC-06, atomic)
  - **agent:** `convex-expert`
  - **deps:** none
  - **docs:** [Plan Task 4](./superpowers/plans/2026-06-17-v1.1-security-hardening.md), [audit SEC-05/SEC-06](./reviews/security-audit-2026-06-17.md)
  - **subtasks:**
    - [ ] `_getTxnById_internal` + `_getCurrentInvoice_internal`; repoint the 4 system callers
    - [ ] Gate + project `getById`/`getCurrentInvoice` (resolve→day-scope→drop `receipt_token`/instruments)
    - [ ] Thread `sessionId` through `useXenditPayment` + charge routes
    - [ ] Auth/IDOR + system-caller-unaffected tests pass
  - **notes:** _(empty)_
- 📋 **[v11-xc-docs]** `docs/SCHEMA.md` + `docs/CHANGELOG.md` + `CLAUDE.md` — document new schema, audit verbs, `BOOTSTRAP_MANAGER_PIN`, activation throttle

## Risks under watch

- **Xendit settlement timing** — payout latency vs cashflow visibility. v0.5 settlements module is the canary; if it ships clean, settlement risk is closed.
- **Single device, single point of failure** — the booth Android dies mid-shift = no sales. Offline draft queue (v0.3) helps but doesn't replace; spare-device protocol needed by v1.0.
- **Telegram bot single point of failure** — all internal staff/manager/founders comms now route through one bot identity (`@FrolliePOS_Bot` for dev, separate prod bot for prod). Failure modes: BotFather token revoked, bot removed from a group, Telegram service outage, or a group silently migrates basic→supergroup (chat_id format changes). Mitigations: secret-token + idempotency at the webhook (already shipped); add telegram delivery-failure alerts (e.g. nightly query on `telegram_log` for OUT rows with non-`ok` responses); document the token-rotation runbook in [`docs/RUNBOOK-telegram.md`](./RUNBOOK-telegram.md) (already covered).
- **PWA install conversion** — staff must add the app to their home screen for offline + reliable launch. Drives the launch playbook in v1.0.
- **Negative-stock discipline** — sales are allowed at zero stock with a flag (ADR-018). Requires manager actually reconciling, or counts drift. Reconciliation UI is v0.5.
- **`/approve` per-token PIN brute** — a live approval token (60-min TTL) lets the holder argon2-verify manager PINs by code with no per-token failed-attempt cap. An attacker who obtains a token can iterate predictable manager codes (`S-0001`, `S-0002`, …) and burn 3 wrong PINs each, locking out every manager and triggering a notify→reset-link feedback loop into the same Telegram group. Mitigation in v0.5 stabilization backlog (per-token cap). Until then: managers should treat a leaked /approve link as P0 — rotate manager PINs and invalidate the request via Convex `_deleteRequest_internal`. _Surfaced 2026-05-30 by `/simplify` post-bf9b2cb._

## Decisions awaiting CTO

- **Cross-deployment integration with Frollie Pro `product_master`** — sync, API call, or shared package? Affects v1.1+ when POS starts reading Pro's `products` table.
- **Receipt printer hardware** — in scope for v1.0 or punt to v1.1? Currently not on the roadmap; booth may want thermal receipts at launch.
- ~~**WhatsApp Cloud API vs share-intent**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-05-26**: chose Telegram bot over WhatsApp for internal staff/manager/founders comms. POC validated round-trip + buttons + idempotency. ADR-027 + ADR-033 superseded by v0.4 work. Customer-facing receipts remain on wa.me share-intent (Telegram requires opt-in, doesn't fit customer flow).
